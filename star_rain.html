                <strong>As a Member of the Autism Services Kids Club</strong>
                <p>While volunteering, I came to realize that mainstream therapy for children with autism in Taiwan still relies on traditional means, such as face-to-face instruction and medical treatment.  I felt strongly that alternative learning methods like educational apps should be leveraged, since many kids showed interest in interacting with digital devices.</p>

                <p>As a UX designer, I keep reflecting on the question: <b style="color: #FF7500;">how might we help children with autism and their families to ease the daily struggle and improve their lives? </b> It inspired me to conduct a UX design project to address the possibility that children with autism could enhance their learning abilities through technology. </p>

            <br> 3. Teaching kids with autism to learn living skills is very exhausted. Parents desire to have effective methods.
            <br> 4. With proper methods, kids can significantly improve their abilities.
            <br> 5. Though special education at school provides classes for living skills and social interaction, there is still a huge difference when they face the real world.
            <br> 6. The autistic symptoms vary widely from one person to the next. It will be suitable if kids can be taught by the one who understands him/her the most. </p>

            <br>2. <b style="color: #FF7500;">Lack of Living Skills</b>: Learning practical skills can be challenging for kids with autism, but is essential for independence (For example, shopping, taking transportation, completing daily chores, house cleaning, doing dishes and cooking).

            <p> We analyzed 20 existing education apps for kids, including learning the alphabet, math, geometry, draw, and music. There were also a few apps designed for learning life skills, like go shopping and take a bus. However, there were two main problems of existing education tools:
            <br> 1. Kids can not connect teaching and gaming contents with the real world.
            <br>2.  Children with autism have individual differences. Each one should be taught and treated by distinct methods. It can make sure that kids receive proper supports and reach person-centered needs.

            <p>At first, we designed a prototype and conducted usability tests both for desktop and app. We found that kids with autism were easier to use an app rather than desktop because some kids had muscle weakness when they controlled the mouses. Later, we shifted focus to the usability tests for mobile devices.</p>
            <p>We conducted fifteen minutes long 1:1 session with 5 kids and 7 parents. After testing, parents did a series of qualitative questions regarding the prototype's interface and functionality. The overall impression was positive and we got insightful feedback. Kids played the games with enthusiastic, and parents loved the features of customizing. The design was able to reduce caregivers' feeling of fatigue when they taught kids repeatedly.  <p> Nevertheless, some parents thought that it won't be attractive for teenagers with autism, and had limited effect. Therefore, it still needs to follow up for a piece of time to value the effect of the design solution and optimize the idea later.</p>

            <p> During the design process, I maintained close connection with the foundation for autistic children and adults in Taiwan, a non-profit organization helping autistic people to deserve a better life. They gave me several feedback based on their professional experience and helped me iterate the design to tackle the real issues. </p>
            <p>Through the process of iteration, I learned how to reach the autistic kids’ market in the digital world, how to improve a product’s usability, and how to place myself in a user’s shoes objectively and comprehensively. I appreciated to have this opportunity and truely understood their needings and pain points. By solving this trivial stuff happened in their every day, I hope that the Star Rain can eventually provide a better life experience.</p>
